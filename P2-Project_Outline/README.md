## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I'm creating an app to research preschools in the Arnold area. When my first started preschool in 2015 there was little to no information available. Preschools all have different hours, rates, class size, location, etc. It starts to feel like you're comparing apples to oranges. My app will breakdown the rate /hr, distance from home, student teacher ratio, if your child needs to be potty trained, starting age and have link to their website. You'll be able to select and compare multiple school and save them to a list in your account.
